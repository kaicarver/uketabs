Printable uke tabs for me to play with...

## Why: for printing

There are lots of ukulele scores out there,
but I find I have problems printing them.

Even when they do print nicely,
they end up too small for me to read easily.

The idea here is to develop a template that makes
any of these common monospace scores easily printable.

The chord charts should also be easy to display
in a nice format on the side, ideally with fingering.
