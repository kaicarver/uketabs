## Notes

There are lots of ukulele scores out there,
but I find I have problems printing them.

Even when they do print nicely,
they end up too small for me to read easily.

The idea here is to develop a template that makes
any of these common monospace scores easily printable.

The chord charts are also easy to display
in a nice format on the side, ideally with fingering.

## TODOs

### Chord charts

Just by scanning the score, the list of chord charts
to display could be automatically generated.

### Info links

add Wikipedia and Youtube links for each song

### Play button

The score could be playable, with a choice of strumming patterns
