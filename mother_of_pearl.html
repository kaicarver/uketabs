  E            D           E                  D     E
      Turn the lights down,       turn up the music,
              (Way down    ...low!)          (Hi as Fi can go!)
   
          D            E
  All the gang's here,
         (Everyone you know!)
  B                                   A
                               It's a crazy scene, oo - hoo!

  [Verse 2]
  E           D            E
      Walk a tight-rope,
       (Your tight side - line!)
   
  E                D            E
            Such a bright hope,
    (Right  place, right     ...time!)
   
  E               D         E

  E                                  B
       Take a powder!

                     A
                     Woo -hoo!

  [Verse 3]
                  D
  Well, I've been up all night again,
  A                      E
  Party-time wasting is  ...too much fun,
          D                     A
  Then I step back thinking of life's inner mean - ing,
          E
  And my    ...latest fling,
           D               A
  It's the same old story, all love and glory,
         E
  It's a pantomime,
             D                    A
  If you're looking for love in a looking-glass world,
               E
  It's pretty   ...hard to find!
   
  [Verse 4]
      D
  Oh, mother of pearl,
  A                            E
  I wouldn't trade you for a - nother girl,
       D                       A
  Di - vine intervention, al - ways my intention,
         E
  So I    ...take my time,
             D                    A
  I've been looking for something I've always wanted,
          E                        D
  But was never mine, but now I've seen that something,
       A                           E
  Just out of reach, glowing, very  ...Holy Grail!
   
  [Verse 5]
      D                 A                 E
  Oh, mother of pearl, lustrous lady of a sacred world,
        D                     A
  Thus, even Zarathustra, a - nother time-loser,
             E                        D
  Could be - lieve in you, with every goddess a let down,
        A                      E
  Every idol a bring down, it  ...gets you down,
          D
  But the search for perfection,
       A                     E
  Your own predilection goes on, and on, and on, and on!
   
  [Verse 6]
        D
  Can - adian Club love,
    A                             E
  A place in the country, every - one's ideal,
              D                  A
  But you are my favorita, and a place in your heart, dear,
            E
  Makes me   ...feel more ...real!
   
  [Verse 7]
      D
  Oh, mother of pearl,
  A                             E
  I wouldn't change you for the  ...whole world,
         D
  You're highbrow holy,
        A                       E
  With lots of soul, melancholy  ...shimmering,
        D                     A
  Ser - pentine sleekness was always my weakness,
          E
  Like a  ...simple tune,
      D             A                        E
  But no dilettante filigree fancy beats the ...plastic you!
   
  [Verse 8]
       D                     A
  Ca - reer-girl cover, ex - posed,
                          E
  And another slips right into view,
      D                     A
  Oh, looking for love in a looking-glass world,
             E                    D
  Is pretty ...hard for you,  few throw-away kisses,
      A                       E
  The boomerang misses, spin  ...'round, and around,
          D
  Fall on feather bed quilted,
  A                               E
  Faced with silk softly stuffed  ...eiderdown,
       D
  Take refuge in pleasure,
       A                               E
  Just give me your future, we'll for   - get your past!
   
  [Verse 9]
      D
  Oh, mother of pearl,
  A                      E
  Submarine lover in a   ...shrinking world,
      D
  Oh, lonely dreamer,
       A                          E
  Your choker provokes a picture  ...cameo,
      D
  Oh, mother of pearl,
       A                         E
  So - so semi-precious in your  ...detached world,
      D
  Oh, mother of pearl,
  A                            E
  I wouldn't trade you for a - nother girl!
   
  [Coda]
      D
  Oh, mother of pearl,
  A                            E
  I wouldn't trade you for a - nother girl,
      D
  Oh, mother of pearl,
  A                            E
  I wouldn't trade you for a - nother girl!
      D
  Oh, mother of pearl,
  N.C.
  I wouldn't trade you for another girl!
