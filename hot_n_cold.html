  G                D
  You change your mind
         Am           C
  Like a girl changes clothes
       G    D
  Yeah you, PMS
         Am
  Like a bitch
          C
  I would know
      G        D
  And you over-think
         Am
  Always speak
        C
  Critically
           G
  I should know
        D                 Am  C
  That you're no good for me 
  
               G
  Cause you're hot then you're cold
         D
  You're yes then you're no
          Am
  You're in then you're out
         C
  You're up then you're down
         G
  You're wrong when it's right
       D
  It's black and it's white
     Am
  We fight, we break up
           C
  We kiss, we make up
   G                             D
  (you) You don't really want to stay, no
  Am                                     C
  (but you) But you don't really want to go-o
         G
  You're hot then you're cold
         D
  You're yes then you're no
         Am
  You're in then you're out
         C
  You're up then you're down 
  
  G          D
  We used to be
            Am           C
  Just like twins, so in sync
      G        D
  The same energy
          Am        C
  now's a dead battery
          G               D
  Used to laugh, 'bout nothing
             Am       C
  Now you're plain boring
           G
  I should know
       D                Am     C
  That you're not gonna change 
  
  (REFRAIN)
  
  C        G
   Someone call the doctor
  D
   Got a case of a love bi-polar
  C           G
   Stuck on a roller coaster
  D
  Can't get off this ride 
  
  G               D
  You change your mind
         Am           C
  Like a girl changes clothes
