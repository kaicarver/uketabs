G                D
You change your mind
       Am           C
Like a girl changes clothes
     G    D
Yeah you, PMS
       Am
Like a bitch
	C
I would know
    G        D
And you over-think
       Am
Always speak
      C
Critically
	 G
I should know
      D                 Am  C
That you're no good for me 

	     G
Cause you're hot then you're cold
       D
You're yes then you're no
	Am
You're in then you're out
       C
You're up then you're down
       G
You're wrong when it's right
     D
It's black and it's white
   Am
We fight, we break up
	 C
We kiss, we make up
 G                             D
(you) You don't really want to stay, no
Am                                     C
(but you) But you don't really want to go-o
       G
You're hot then you're cold
       D
You're yes then you're no
       Am
You're in then you're out
       C
You're up then you're down 

G          D
We used to be
	  Am           C
Just like twins, so in sync
    G        D
The same energy
	Am        C
now's a dead battery
	G               D
Used to laugh, 'bout nothing
	   Am       C
Now you're plain boring
	 G
I should know
     D                Am     C
That you're not gonna change 

(REFRAIN)

C        G
 Someone call the doctor
D
 Got a case of a love bi-polar
C           G
 Stuck on a roller coaster
D
Can't get off this ride 

G               D
You change your mind
       Am           C
Like a girl changes clothes
