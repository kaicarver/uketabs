Verse:
       C              G                 Am          F
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me,
C                 G              F  Em Dm C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
    C              G                Am                F
And in the hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me,

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Verse:

And when the broken-hearted people, living in the world agree,
C                G              F  Em Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be.
    C                  G                Am                  F
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see,
C                G              F  Em Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be.

Chorus:
       Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

There will be an answer, let it be.
