    Intro: riff - Am D Am D

    Verse:
    Am                C
    All around me are familiar faces 
    G                 D
    Worn out places – worn out faces 
    Am                          C
    Bright and early for their daily races 
    G               D
    Going nowhere – going nowhere 
    Am                      C
    Their tears are filling up their glasses 
    G             D
    No expression – no expression 
    Am                     C
    Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow 
    G           D
    No tomorrow – no tomorrow 
    
    Chorus:
    Am                  D                      Am
    And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad 
    Am                      D                            Am
    The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had 
    Am                 D                           Am
    I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take 
    Am                  D
    When people run in circles it’s a very very 
    Am             D
       Maaaaaad world 
    Am             D
       Maaaaaad world 
    
    Verse:
    Am                        C
    Children waiting for the day they feel good 
    G               D
    Happy birthday – happy birthday 
    Am                        C
    Made to feel the way that every child should 
    G               D
     Sit and listen – sit and listen 

    Am                       C
    Went to school and I was very nervous 
    G              D
    No one knew me – no one knew me 
    Am                     C
    Hello teacher tell me what’s my lesson 
    G                     D
    Look right through me – look right through me 
    
    Chorus:
    Am                  D                      Am
    And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad 
    Am                      D                             Am
    The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had 
    Am                D                            Am
    I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take 
    Am                  D
    When people run in circles it’s a very very 
    Am             D
       Maaaaaad world 
    Am                D
    Enlarge your world 
    Am       D
    Mad world
