    Intro: riff - Em A Em A
    
    Verse:
    Em                G
    All around me are familiar faces 
    D                 A
    Worn out places – worn out faces 
    Em                          G
    Bright and early for their daily races 
    D               A
    Going nowhere – going nowhere 
    Em                      G
    Their tears are filling up their glasses 
    D             A
    No expression – no expression 
    Em                     G
    Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow 
    D           A
    No tomorrow – no tomorrow 
    
    Chorus:
    Em                  A                      Em
    And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad 
    Em                      A                            Em
    The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had 
    Em                 A                           Em
    I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take 
    Em                  A
    When people run in circles it’s a very very 
    Em             A
       Maaaaaad world 
    Em             A
       Maaaaaad world 
    
    Verse:
    Em                        G
    Children waiting for the day they feel good 
    D               A
    Happy birthday – happy birthday 
    Em                        G
    Made to feel the way that every child should 
    D               A
     Sit and listen – sit and listen 
    Em                       G
    Went to school and I was very nervous 
    D              A
    No one knew me – no one knew me 
    Em                     G
    Hello teacher tell me what’s my lesson 
    
    D                     A
    Look right through me – look right through me 
    
    Chorus:
    Em                  A                      Em
    And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad 
    Em                      A                             Em
    The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had 
    Em                A                            Em
    I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take 
    Em                  A
    When people run in circles it’s a very very 
    Em             A
       Maaaaaad world 
    Em                A
    Enlarge your world 
    Em       A
    Mad world
