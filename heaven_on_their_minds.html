    HEAVEN ON THEIR MINDS (Judas)
    [4/4, Chords played over the - - - - progression/bass riff]
    
    My mind is clearer now at last all to well
    
    I can see where we all soon will be
    
    If you strip away the myth from the man
    
    You will see where we all soon will be
    
    Jesus! You've started to believe the things they say of you
    
    You really do believe this talk of God is true
    
    And all the good you've done will soon get swept away
    
    You've begun to matter more than the things you say
    
    Listen Jesus I don't like what I see
    
    All I ask is that you listen to me
    
    And remember I've been your right-hand man all along
    
    You have set them all on fire
    
    They think they've found the new Messiah
     +
    And they'll hurt you when they find their wrong
    
    I remember when this whole thing began
    
    No talk of God then we called you a man
    
    And believe me my admiration for you hasn't died
    
    But ev'ry word you say today
    
    Gets twisted 'round some other way
     +
    And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied
    [in 7/8]
    
    Nazareth your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
     /
    Like his father carving wood he'd have made good

    Tables chairs and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best
     /
    He'd have caused nobody harm -- no one alarm
    back to 4/4]
    
    Listen Jesus do you care for your race?
    
    Don't you see we must keep in our place?
    
    We are occupied -- have you forgotten how put down we are?
    
    I am frightened by the crowd
    
    For we are getting much too loud
     / +
    And they'll crush us if we go too far
    [back to 7/8, instrumental break repeating previous 7/8 bridge]
    [back to 4/4]
    
    Listen Jesus to the warning I give
    
    Please remember that I want us to live
    
    But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
    
    All your followers are blind
    
    Too much heaven on their minds
     / +
    It was beautiful but now it's sour
    
    Yes it's all gone sour...

    EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT (Mary, Jesus, Judas)
    [in 5/4]
    [Mary]
    
    Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to problems that upset you oh
    
    Don't you know everything's alright yes, everything's fine
    
    And we want you to sleep well tonight
    
    Let the world turn without you tonight
    
    If we try we'll get by so forget about all us tonight
    
    Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine
    [Judas]
    
    Woman your fine ointment -- brand new and expensive
    
    could have been saved for the poor
    
    Why has it been wasted -- we could have raised maybe
    
    Three hundred silver pieces or more
    
    People who are hungry, people who are starving
