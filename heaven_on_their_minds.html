[4/4, Chords played over the Eb Cm Dm Eb Cm progression/bass riff]

           Dm             F            G
My mind is clearer now at last all too well
      F            G             Dm
I can see where we all soon will be
       Dm             F             G
If you strip away the myth from the man
         F            G             Dm
You will see where we all soon will be

              Dm                     Em
Jesus! You've started to believe the things they say of you
    F                      G                  Dm
You really do believe this talk of God is true
    Dm                            Em
And all the good you've done will soon get swept away
F                           G                      Dm
You've begun to matter more than the things you say

Dm                   F
Listen Jesus I don't like what I see
Dm                    G
All I ask is that you listen to me
Bb           C                             F        A
And remember I've been your right-hand man all along
         Dm                  Bb
You have set them all on fire
                F
They think they've found the new Messiah
            D/A                A+   A       Bb   Dm7
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

Dm                   F
I remember when this whole thing began
Dm                     G
No talk of God then we called you a man
Bb             C                     F          A
And believe me my admiration for you hasn't died
          Dm                Bb
But ev'ry word you say today
             F
Gets twisted 'round some other way
            D/A              A+    A      Bb  Dm7
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

[in 7/8]

Bb            F          Gm                   Dm
Nazareth your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Gm              Dm/A         A              Dm
Like his father carving wood he'd have made good
Bb                F            Gm                Dm
Tables chairs and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best
Gm                 Dm/A         A           Dm
He'd have caused nobody harm -- no one alarm

[back to 4/4]

Dm                  F
Listen Jesus do you care for your race?
Dm                    G
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
Bb                 C                          F           A
We are occupied -- have you forgotten how put down we are?
     Dm                     Bb
I am frightened by the crowd
           F
For we are getting much too loud
            Dm/A           A+ A   Bb Dm7
And they'll crush us if we go too far

[back to 7/8, instrumental break repeating previous 7/8 bridge]

[back to 4/4]

Dm                  F
Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Dm                     G
Please remember that I want us to live
Bb                      C                      F         A
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
         Dm                 Bb
All your followers are blind
         F
Too much heaven on their minds
       Dm/A          A+  A    Bb
It was beautiful but now it's sour
         Dm       Bbmaj7
Yes it's all gone sour...
